# Disnine.js - A unique discord.js Framework
Disnine.js was created to make boilerplate v9 API code more easy than ever. It's still in beta, and there are a lot of things missing (I don't have free time lol).

## Installation
You can get Disnine from npm:
```npm i disnine.js```

You can also checkout the template/example project: https://github.com/PolPtoAmo/DisnineBotExample/

## FAQ
**Question:** You're using types and interfaces poorly

**Answer:** I'm just starting on TypeScript, so obviusly my types will suck. You can always collaborate with this project to make it better :D
